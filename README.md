#ESP32BluetoothSerial Problem
I was working with esp32 BluetoothSerial but whenever i send it a value it gives out three value on the Serial monitor.
First value was the value i send  it and other two were random 
I didnt investigated the issue but wrote a code for anyone who is facing the same problem
The code is very simple 
By using array we can solve this issue
Update the code if u have more efficient way to do
